Reading the Docs

People say something along the lines of: "It's good for you to spend time struggling and reading the docs. You'll learn how to learn."

What do they mean when they say, "You'll learn how to learn."???

Well, what are the determinants of you learning the concept in question? Loosly:
- It helps to know where to look. Ie. what resources are available to you (Stack Overflow is a big one). What the right terms to google are. How documentation is organized. What blogs are likely to have answers. Etc.
- It helps to be persistant. Meaning having the emotional ability to push through frustration and to continue to apply effort towards the problem.
- It helps a lot to be able to break the problem down into its components and isolate the issues. To figure out what it is that you don't know (or at least to make progress towards this). This requires 1) having the proper reductionst mindset and 2) the ability to keep track of everything in your head (ie. build a mental model). As far as 2) goes, part of being good at this is having the short term memory capacity to keep track of things. But a big part of it that I think gets ignored is your ability to diagram things out. Or really, how quickly you resort to diagram things out (I think most people are too lazy to do this. It takes time to get a notebook out, clear space on your desk, think about how to diagram it, actually write it out etc.)
- It helps to know when to give up.
- It helps to ask for help. A lot of people don't have the willingness to do this. Sometimes they are afraid of seeming stupid. Sometimes they don't like bothering other people.

Anyway, does trying to read the docs help you "learn how to learn"? Let's use the bullet points above as an operational definition of "knowing how to learn". And let's analyze how struggling through the docs helps you with each bullet point. In my experience...
- It helps with knowing where to look.
- It helps a bit with developing a more persistant mindset.
- It does help a decent amount with developing the ability to break things down.
- People don't make much progress as far as this goes. They don't get much better at identifying the times when they should give up. This has a lot to do with stubbornness, and stubornness doesn't change much.
- People don't change much here either. Again, this is more of a personality thing. Pride, embarassment, etc.

However, I think that there are huge diminishing returns. You don't really get that much better at knowing what resources are available. Or at being persistant, knowing when to give up, knowing when to ask for help.

As far as learning how to break down a problem goes, I think it depends on the person. A lot of people just give up after a certain point. These people have a certain approach and struggling through documentation doesn't help them alter their approach. For others, it is good practice struggling with something and having to identify what it really is that you don't know. I think there are better ways to develop this ability, but I still think struggling through documentation ranks as medium-good.

Anyway, I have two main points:
1: If you want people to develop the skills I mention in the bullet points, teach them more directly. Teach people where to look. Teach them how to break problems down. Call them out on times where they are being too stubborn. Too prideful. Too shy. Explain that it's not in their interest to do so and that they're being irrational. Call them out for being too lazy to take the time to diagram things out.
2: Even considering the potential benefits of struggling through documentation, there are probably better uses of your time. Being able to read documentation depends on the amount of knowledge you already have. Often times the documentation uses terms and concepts and things you don't know, and these things are dependencies that prevent you from understanding the documentation. As you learn more, these dependency roadblocks happen less and less, and thus you become more and more capable of learning via reading the documentation. But to develop this ability, it's really just knowledge that you're after. Not so much "learning how to learn". Having a bigger base of knowledge makes it easier to learn more.
